- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt Pfeifer. I'm a coffee nerd, husband, pug dad, and lover of science & engineering.
- 👀 I have 5 years of experience in data analysis & mathematical models. I currently develop optimization models that power
analysis and planning tools for the Navy with <a href="https://navalnuclearlab.energy.gov/">Naval Nuclear Laboratory</a> (contractor, not actively enlisted).
- 🌱 I’m obsessed with Web3 and crypto and have been strengthening my backend dev portfolio with Solidity smart contract projects, 
while building a new appreciation for frontend development with JavaScript and its React.js framework.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on new and exciting projects in the Web3 space (NFTs, dApps, DeFi, the more the merrier!).
- ✨ My goal is to jump from the Web2 world into a fulltime Web3 gig so I can be an active part of the coming wave of blockchain innovation!
- 📫 I can be reached on Twitter <a href="twitter.com/matthewcpfeifer">@matthewcpfeifer</a>, on Discord @ PFEIFLIFE#2222, and my email is matthewcpfeifer@gmail.com
