- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt. I'm a coffee nerd, husband, pug dad, and lifelong learner.
- 👀 I have 5 years of experience in data analysis & mathematical models. I currently develop optimization models that power
analysis and planning tools for the Navy.
- 🌱 I’m obsessed with Web3 and have been building in this space for the better part of a year, strengthening my dev portfolio with NFT projects on ETH and SOL. While I mostly build frontend applications in Javascript frameworks, I have some experience inside smart contracts and am actively working to master Rust 🛠 🦞 
- 👼 I'm a frontend dev with DeGods on the Solana network and I'm looking to take on more contract work. My goal is to jump from the 9-5 world into the 24/7 wild west of Web3 🤝 
- 📫 I can be reached on Twitter <a href="twitter.com/web3_degen">@web3_degen</a>, on Discord @ matt.sol#2222, and my email is matthewcpfeifer@gmail.com
