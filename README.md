- 👋 Husband, pug dad, coffee nerd, and lifelong learner.
- 👼 I'm a frontend dev with DeGods on the Solana blockchain.
- 👀 For the first 5 years of my career, I developed training software and optimization models that power analysis and planning tools for the Navy.
- 🌱 I’ve recently jumped into Web3 full time after building in this space for the better part of a year; I am always working on strengthening my dev portfolio with NFT projects on ETH and SOL and strengthening my core CS fundamentals. While I mostly build frontend applications in Javascript frameworks, I have some experience inside smart contracts and am actively working to master Rust 🛠 🦞 
- 📫 I can be reached on Twitter <a href="twitter.com/web3_degen">@web3_degen</a>, on Discord @ matt.sol#2222, and my email is matt.sol.degods@gmail.com
